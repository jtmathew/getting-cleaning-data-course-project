## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Description of Data and Variables
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

*  mean(): Mean value
*  std(): Standard deviation
*  mad(): Median absolute deviation 
*  max(): Largest value in array
*  min(): Smallest value in array
*  sma(): Signal magnitude area
*  energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
*  iqr(): Interquartile range 
*  entropy(): Signal entropy
*  arCoeff(): Autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
*  correlation(): Correlation coefficient between two signals
*  maxInds(): Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
*  meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
*  skewness(): Skewness of the frequency domain signal 
*  kurtosis(): Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
*  bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT
   of each window.
*  angle(): Angle between some vectors.

Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Run Analysis Data Transformations 

Section 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Read data files from:
- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

Assign column names and merge to create one data set.

## Section 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Create a logcal vector that contains TRUE values for the ID, mean and stdev columns and FALSE values for the others.
Subset this data to keep only the necessary columns.

## Section 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Merge data subset with the activityType table to cinlude the descriptive activity names

## Section 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

## Section 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
