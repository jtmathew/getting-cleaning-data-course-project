## Getting and Cleaning Data Project


## Project Overview
In this project data from the The UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is cleaned and presented as a tidyData.txt file. 

## Project Summary
The following is a rundown of the procedures undertaken by the run_analysis.R file. 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## Additional Information
Working directory must be set to local data file location. 
Variables, data, and transformation information can be found in the CodeBook.MD file.
